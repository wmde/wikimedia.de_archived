For development the hostnames `wmde-site.test` and `www.wmde-site.test` are used.

## Setup

Configuration files for NGINX and must must be installed to run the website. The
configuration templates can be found inside hte `config` directory. They use the
following placeholders:

- `__NAKED_DOMAIN__`, i.e. `wikimedia.de`
- `__PATH__`, i.e. `/var/www/wikimedia.de`
- `__NGINX_INCLUDES_PATH__`, i.e. `/path/to/config/web/includes`

FPM, i.e. in `/etc/php/7.0/fpm/conf.d`.

The NGINX configuration can be moved to a different place and the main
server configuration file be included in `/etc/nginx.conf` `include
/path/to/config/web/servers/app.conf`.

from `/etc/ssl/certs/__NAKED_DOMAIN__.crt` and
`/etc/ssl/private/__NAKED_DOMAIN__.key` respectively.

The access log is disabled and errors are logged to syslog.
